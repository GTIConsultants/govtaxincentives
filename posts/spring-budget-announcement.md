Further to the Chancellor's Spring Budget, please see a summary of the annoucments relevant to the R&D tax incentive below:\
\
Amongst the announcements include.

* Confirmation that, from 1 April 2023, the RDEC rate will increase from 13% to 20%, and the SME rate of relief will decrease from an additional deduction of 130% to 86%.
* For loss-making SMEs, the R&D Tax Credit (RDTC) (i.e., the cash credit on surrendered R&D losses) will also decrease from 14.5% to 10% for most claimants. However, for R&D-intensive loss-making, the RDTC will remain at the current rate of 14.5%, with "R&D-intensive" being defined as those SMEs for which qualifying R&D expenditure constitutes at least 40% of the company's total expenditure.
* For accounting periods starting on or after 1 April 2023, expenditure on data licenses and cloud computing services will be included in the categories of qualifying expenditure, and the definition will be extended to include mathematics' - clarifying, in particular, that pure maths can qualify. However, the proposed restrictions on Overseas R&D expenditure will now be deferred to accounting periods starting on or after 1 April 2024.
* For all R&D claims submitted on or after 1 August 2023, a separate Additional information form will need to be submitted digitally for a claim to be valid. Please see the attachment for further detail on this.
* The consultation on merging the RDEC and SME schemes has closed but no decision has yet been made. However, the Government intends to keep open the option to implement a merged scheme in April 2024.
* No significant announcements were made in respect of the Patent Box regime; however, it was confirmed that the 10% rate on Patent Box profits will remain.
